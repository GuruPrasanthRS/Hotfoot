**daily UPI behavior** to surface short-term fluctuations and anomaly candidates.  \n","Notebook 2 evaluated **monthly macro patterns** to assess growth quality, concentration, and stability.\n","\n","However, the problem statement requires more than separate analyses.\n","\n","It asks for a **system-level judgment**:\n","> Are the observed patterns signs of risk, or evidence of a maturing digital infrastructure?\n","\n","Notebook 3 provides that judgment.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## What this notebook does\n","\n","This notebook **integrates insights from Notebook 1 and Notebook 2** to:\n","- Separate **signal from noise**\n","- Classify anomalies as **normal, operational, or structural**\n","- Translate metrics into **decision-ready conclusions**\n","\n","The emphasis is on **interpretation, not computation**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Core questions answered\n","\n","This notebook addresses four regulator-relevant questions:\n","\n","1. **Signal vs Noise**  \n","   Do daily anomalies persist at the monthly level, or get absorbed?\n","\n","2. **Structural Dependency**  \n","   Is UPI dominance creating fragility or stability?\n","\n","3. **Growth Quality**  \n","   Is UPI growth healthy, volatile, or misleading?\n","\n","4. **Early Warning Framework**  \n","   What patterns should trigger monitoring or investigation?\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Approach\n","\n","We combine:\n","- Daily system anomaly flags (Notebook 1)\n","- Monthly regime classification and concentration metrics (Notebook 2)\n","- Persistence and consistency logic across time scales\n","\n","All conclusions are based on:\n","- Aggregated data\n","- Publicly observable system behavior\n","- Reproducible statistical logic\n","\n","---\n","\n","## What this notebook does *not* do\n","\n","To remain aligned with scope and data limitations, this notebook does **not**:\n","- Perform transaction-level or bank-level forensics\n","- Attribute causality without evidence\n","- Make speculative claims\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Final outcome\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, we produce:\n","- A **clear system-health assessment**\n","- A **risk taxonomy** distinguishing noise, operational stress, and structural risk\n","- A **reusable monitoring framework** suitable for regulators and policymakers\n","\n","This is where analysis becomes **insight**, and insight becomes **decision**."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import
